Offline-first, privacy-focused options payoff and volatility surface simulator. Explore payoff diagrams for any option combination interactively using the Softplus pricing model (a quick and dirty approximation that avoids Black-Scholes rigidity). Markets are uncertain — no model is the ultimate truth. That’s why this app is built for play and intuition: tweak the volatility surface and instantly see how shocks, skew changes, term-structure shifts, or full volatility regime changes affect your strategy.

Features:

- Financial modeling of option prices linked to an interactive volatility surface.

- Navigate and stress-test strategies across realistic market volatility scenarios.

- No tracking, no data ever leaves your machine.
